Its prestigious history of wealthy residents has made the number of distinct architectural gems hard to count. Extending from Central Park to the East River between 59th Street and 95th Street in Manhattan, the Upper East Side is a a bastion of Manhattan sophistication, and therein lies its attraction. The avenues themselves are synonymous with high-class living: Madison Ave holds numerable high-end retail shops; Park Ave has long been the residence of choice for New York elites; and 5th Avenue?s Museum Mile boasts some of the country's most visited cultural institutions, such as the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

This is my most favorite apartment, so I am very sad to go. Targeting June 1st move in for you, but can negotiate if you want to move in earlier. We will probably be out the last weekend in May. If you are interested, please email me to set up a time to see the place. I'm usually able to show it after 7 pm on weeknights and during the day on weekends.

Easily the best deal! <br /><br />New York City?s business hub is also a great neighborhood to call home, complete with upscale luxury apartments, numerous attractions, and a thriving atmosphere. Architecture fans will of course notice two preeminent buildings in the area, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building further up, while others will enjoy the one-of-a-kind hustle and bustle, but there are plenty of highlights outside of these well-known icons. Murray Hill will afford proximity to work while providing a trove of places to play. The diverse culinary scene ranging from hole-in-the-wall dive bars and pub fare to fine Indian cuisine and modern Asian fusion pairs nicely with the cultural attractions like Rockefeller Center, the NY Public Library, Broadway theaters and numerous music and movie venues. Newcomers to Manhattan and New York veterans alike will find that living in Murray Hill and Midtown exceeds the expectation of what city life should be.
